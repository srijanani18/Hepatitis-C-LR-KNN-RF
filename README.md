# Hepatitis-C-LR-KNN-RF

This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on predicting Hepatitis C using Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of Hepatitis C patients' records, including various features such as age, sex, bilirubin levels, albumin levels, and more. The dataset is not included in this repository but can be obtained from [source link](https://www.exampledatasetlink.com).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hepatitis-C-LR-KNN-RF.git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hepatitis-C-LR-KNN-RF.git

##Install the required dependencies:
shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Make sure you have the dataset file (e.g., hepatitis_c_data.csv) in the project directory.

##Run the main script:

shell
Copy code
  python main.py
This script performs data preprocessing, feature selection, model training using LR, KNN, and RF algorithms, and evaluates their performance using cross-validation.

##Results
The results of the model evaluation, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each algorithm, will be displayed in the console output.
